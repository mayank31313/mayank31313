I am Java and Python Developer in year 2018 I started to work on a problem of iot and real time control so I developed a solution that is capable of controlling autonomous robots/devices later renamed it as Control Net https://mayank31313.github.io to control multirotors over Internet. The Control Net Stack has an ecosystem of multiple applications/connectos/services/frameworks. Check out the Control Net Home page [here](https://mayank31313.github.io)
